Choosing the right open-source license is crucial for setting clear usage terms. Consider how you want others to use and modify your work, and refer to Ready Tensor’s [License Guide](https://app.readytensor.ai/publications/licenses-for-ml-projects-a-primer-qWBpwY20fqSz) to select the most suitable option.

**3. Add Relevant Tags**
Tags help users discover your work more easily. Use specific and accurate tags that reflect your research domain, methodology, and key concepts.

A well-organized repository increases the usability of your project. Ensure your repository includes:
- A detailed **README file** with a clear description, installation steps, usage instructions, and dataset details.
- A logical file structure that makes it easy to navigate.
- Code **documentation** and **comments** to help users understand and extend your work effortlessly.
- **Dependencies** listed in `requirements.txt` or `project.toml` or similar file.  
-  **License file** clarifying the rights and permissions you are granting to others.
