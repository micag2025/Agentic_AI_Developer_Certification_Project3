- Program Overview
- How to Enroll
- How the Program Works
- Program Schedule
- Certification Process
- Project Details
- Team-Based Learning

# What You'll Learn

This program is structured into three comprehensive modules, each culminating in a practical, portfolio-worthy project:

- **Module 1 (Weeks 1–4): Foundations of Agentic AI**
  Explore core concepts including agent architectures, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and tool use. You'll build your first project—a question-answering assistant.

- **Module 2 (Weeks 5–8): Architecting Agentic Workflows**
  Learn to implement complex workflows, multi-agent collaboration, and Model Context Protocol (MCP)-aligned systems. Your second project involves creating a sophisticated multi-agent system.

- **Module 3 (Weeks 9–12): Real-World Readiness**
  Master guardrails, evaluation strategies, logging, documentation, and deployment using FastAPI or Streamlit. In your final project, you'll deliver a production-quality agentic AI system.

# How to Enroll

Follow these steps to enroll in the program:

1. **Register for a free account** on Ready Tensor (if you don't have one already). [Sign-up here](https://app.readytensor.ai/signup).
2. **Enroll in the program**. Navigate to the [`Ready Tensor Certifications` hub](https://app.readytensor.ai/hubs/ready_tensor_certifications).
3. Near the top of the page, click the **"Request to Join"** button to request access. Note the button will not be visible unless you are logged into the platform (see Step 1 above).
4. Once your request to join is approved, you are officially enrolled! You'll have immediate access to program materials, including weekly lectures, reading materials, and project guidelines.

The program begins on May 19th, 2025. You can enroll up until June 6th, the due date for the first project.--DIVIDER--# Certification is Free — Expert Feedback is Optional

The certification program is completely free. All participants who complete the requirements will receive an official **Agentic AI Developer Certificate**.

However, if you wish to receive **expert feedback and guidance** on your projects, you can subscribe to the **Pro** or **Team** plan on Ready Tensor. These plans include structured project reviews, personalized feedback, and direct support from AI experts to help you refine your work and grow faster.--DIVIDER--# How the Program Works

Each week follows a consistent and engaging format:

- **Weekly Lectures**: Pre-recorded sessions (30–60 minutes) that cover key concepts. Each lecture includes a Q&A segment based on participant questions from the previous week's content, hosted via our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/vNevxPqGQS) server.

- **Reading Materials**: Curated readings, publications, and templates provided weekly to deepen your understanding and support your project work.

- **Weekly Assignments**: Practical, task-oriented assignments that progressively build toward each module’s project. These are not graded, but serve as structured practice to help you prepare.

- **Community Engagement**: Join our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/vNevxPqGQS) for ongoing discussions, collaborative learning, and peer support.

- **Project Submissions**: You’ll submit one main project per module (three in total), either individually or in teams of up to five. Projects must be published on a Ready Tensor platform to be eligible for grading.--DIVIDER--# Program Schedule
