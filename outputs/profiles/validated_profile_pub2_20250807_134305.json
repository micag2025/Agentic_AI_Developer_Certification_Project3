    "The `ResourceTracker` provides a more accurate and comprehensive view of resource usage in Python applications compared to `tracemalloc`.",
    "It addresses the underestimation of memory usage in libraries like PyTorch and the overestimation in libraries like NumPy.",
    "The `ResourceTracker` includes multi-faceted memory tracking, continuous monitoring, GPU support, execution time measurement, and easy integration into existing code."
