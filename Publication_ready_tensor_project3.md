## TL;DR
TO BE DRAFTED 

## Tool Overview & Architecture
This project uses a sample dataset and is built around (is structured on) a modular LangChain-based pipeline.

### Sample Dataset:
A collection of 35 Ready Tensor publications, each of them characterised by id, username, license, title, and publication description. There are 6 types of licenses; 27 publications use “MIT” or “CC”, the rest are “none” or missing. Under MIT/CC, reuse is permitted for open source projects.

### Features & Modules:
This project is structured on a modular LangChain-based pipeline in which each feature is mapped to the specific tool or module implementing it:


### Workflow: The LangChain-based pipeline is designed to:
