# This Dockerfile is optimized for Streamlit apps and includes best practices:
# - Installs dependencies before copying the entire source (for build caching).
# - Exposes the correct port and sets recommended environment variables.
# - Runs your app from the src/app.py entry point.


# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.10-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy requirements.txt first to leverage Docker cache for dependencies for Production image
COPY requirements.txt .

# Copy requirement files first to leverage Docker cache for Development/testing image
#COPY requirements.txt requirements-test.txt ./


# Install dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Expose the port Streamlit uses
EXPOSE 8501

# Default environment variables (can be overridden at runtime)
ENV STREAMLIT_SERVER_PORT=8501 \
    STREAMLIT_SERVER_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0

# Run the Streamlit app
CMD ["streamlit", "run", "src/app.py"]
